title: "Lab 4 - Dynamic Quarto Dashboards"
description: "This lab once again involved expanding upon the work done in the previous lab, where I created a static Quarto dashboard. Now that we had a baseline setup of our dashboard, we needed to find ways of incorporating user input. I did this by creating a Shiny app."

Since this is a Shiny app rather than an html file, I can't publish it here. But, I included the link to where the dashboard is published on shinyapps.io.
