## Quarto

First, let's make sure you know how to use Markdown formatting to style a Quarto document.

1.  **Make this text bold.**

2.  *Make this text italicized.*

3.  Make these into a bullet point list:

-   Apples

-   Bananas

-   Potatoes

4.  Edit the YAML to remove warning messages from being output in the rendered HTML file

5.  Using code chunk options, make it so this chunk shows the plot but not the source code:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| label: remove-source-code
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "", 
       title = "Highway Milage (mpg) for Different Car Manufacturers"
       )
```

6.  Using code chunk options, remove the messages about bandwidth `geom_density_ridges()` chose to use:

```{r}
#| label: remove-bandwidth-message
#| message: FALSE
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "", 
       title = "Highway Milage (mpg) for Different Car Manufacturers"
       )
```

7.  Using code chunk options, make it so that these plots are printed side-by-side:

```{r}
#| label: side-by-side-plot
#| layout-ncol: 2
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "", 
       title = "Highway Milage (mpg) for Different Car Manufacturers"
       )

ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(y = manufacturer, x = hwy)) + 
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "", 
       title = "Highway Milage (mpg) for Different Car Manufacturers"
       )

```
